### Hi! I'm Sergio 😁
I'm currently a computer engineer student at the University of Guadalajara 👨🏽‍🎓.
I have knowledge in languages such as C, C++, Java and Python, although I consider that my strong point is Python 🐍.
Currently I'm learning about web development with Javascript (it's a new programming language for me) 🤯.
