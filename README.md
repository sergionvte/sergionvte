👋 Hello there! I'm Sergio, a passionate developer who loves working with Python and Flask. Currently pursuing my engineering degree, I'm constantly exploring and learning new things related to programming.

👨‍💻 I enjoy tackling challenges and finding creative solutions to complex problems. My primary focus lies in web development using the Flask framework (I am also currently learning Django and React), but I also have experience in other areas of software development.

🎨 Besides my programming endeavors, I have a few hobbies that help me maintain a balance. I find solace in painting, and I'm always eager to experiment with different art styles. Reading is another favorite pastime of mine.

🌱 I'm excited about collaborating on interesting projects and learning from talented developers. I'm open to new opportunities and constantly seeking to expand my knowledge in the field of programming.

🤝 Feel free to reach out to me and share ideas! Together, we can create innovative solutions and make the tech world a better place.
